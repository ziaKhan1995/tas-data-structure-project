"Semester Assignment_068.cpp" is the file containing the driver program

User Defined Classes:
	-Node
	-Queue
	-Stack
	-Time
	-DataStrucresStudent
	-teachingAssistant

Method to read from "input.txt"
	Global function used to push values onto Laptop Stack
	Member functions used to insert values in DataStrucresStudent and teachingAssistant accordingly

Method to keep track of Time
	Time class made with several operators overloaded to write the main code easily. It stores time
	in 24hrs format but when required to display its values on Console Application or write data on
	file "output.txt", it writes in AM and PM format. Since our time range stays in PM, the TIME class
	ignored any condition to write AM.

All files are included in this .rar file. Console Application output only shows when the LAB ends on each day
