TA Data Structures Problem 
## The Problem: 
 
Department of Computer Science students, although awesome, are major procrastinators!!!   You give them two weeks for an assignment, and, inevitably, they wait till two or three days before the due  date  to  actually  start  working  on  it, and  that’s  for  the  average  CS students. But then there are those that just really love punishment and wait until the actual due date to begin coding. Invariably, and as with all programming students (even those that start early), these students run into obstacles in their understanding of the assignment, the requirements, the way to code, the syntax, and they end up having a plethora of questions. 
 
So, what happens: the Department, has assigned some TA’s for DS lab and they sit in the TA’s Lab assigned for TA’s by the Department, several TAs have been sitting idle, checking email and Facebook for a week and a half, finally gets busy.  The Monday before due date, a lot of students show up. Tuesday comes, and the number of students wanting help more than doubles. Wednesday...?  Well, Wednesday is just stupid! SOOO many students come, wanting help, and unfortunately, not all receive the help they require because of the overwhelmingly large number of students. 
 
## The Problem:   
with such a congestion of students, the TAs have no way of knowing who was first, who should come next,  etc.    And to get help, you basically need  to  be  an extrovert, willing to  chase  down  one  of  the  TAs  and  drag  them  to  your  desk  for  help. What if you’re a shy student?  There’s a  good chance you may not receive help. 
 
## The solution to this problem is rather trivial:   
any student who has a question MUST stand in LINE to ask a question from the TA.   To be fair and to prevent one student from monopolizing a TA’s time,  if  a  student  has  several  questions,  they  can  only  ask  one question at a time.   After they ask their first question, if they have subsequent questions, they must go to the back of the line and again wait for their turn.  For the purposes of this assignment, we assume that each question takes exactly 5 minutes to answer, which we will refer to as one Q/A session between a student and TA. 
 
Additionally, for the purpose of streamlining the lab, facilitating the procurement of help, and eliminating extraneous problems related to different compilers, coding bugs and suspicious errors, etc., the UNIVERISTY TA Lab (aka the “the Cave”) comes equipped with a Laptop  Dispensing  Minion  (LDM). The students will issue the laptops from the LDM and will use them for their work until the closing hours when they will have to deposit them back to LDM. 
These state-of-the-art (well at  least  for  2020)  laptops  are  sporting  Microsoft  Windows 10, several software’s along with Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 and the current version of DEV-C++ and a fully functional and updated Kaspersky’s Antivirus. 
 
Before a student can stand in the TA line and get help from a TA, each student must first stand in  the    laptop  line  to  take/issue a  laptop  from  the  LDM.    When  a  student  has finished asking all of their questions, or when the TAs are no longer in the lab (because they have left for the day), the student must then enter the laptop line to return the laptop to the LDM, BEFORE they can exit the lab. 
 
We assume that  the process of issuing a laptop takes one minute, and the process  of returning  a  laptop  also  takes  one  minute.    We  also  assume  (and  rightly  so!)  that  all  UNIVERISTY, students are honest and would never, ever, ever take one of these rock-star laptops with them. Therefore, for the purpose of this simulation, all students who take a laptop do indeed return the laptops. 
 
Your Assignment is to write a simulation that models the aforementioned lab specifications for the three days (Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday) before an assignment is due.  Your three-day simulation will run p times, where p is the number of programs in the semester. 
 
You will need to implement this as follows: 
 
## Students: 
You will need to make a student Class as follows: 
```
class DataStructuresStudent { 
string firstName; 
string lastName; 
int enterTime; 
int numQuestions; 
int unanswered; 
int laptopSerialNum; 
} student; 
 ````
•	firstName and lastName should be self-explanatory 
•	enterTime is the time, in minutes after 12:00 PM that a student enters the lab. For example, if the value here was 0, that means the student enters the lab when it opens, at 12:00 PM.  If the value here were 141, that means that this student enters the lab at 141 minutes after 12:00 PM, or 2:21 PM 
•	numQuestions is a single positive integer representing the number of questions that this student wants to ask 
•	numAnswered is the number of questions that were answered.  Depending on lab congestion, there is a chance that not all questions will get answered.  As such, we will track how many questions each student has had answered, and we will use this when printing individual exit detail as well as the overall lab statistics 
•	laptopSerialNum is the serial number of the laptop this student borrows while in the lab 
 
You will read the list of students attending office hours from a file.  These students will be stored in an  array  of  pointers,  where  each  pointer  points  to  an object DataStructuresStudent (aka Student) in memory.   So at some point of the simulation, if there are 140 students that are read into the file, you will make an array, 140 cells long, of pointers to  student.  Then, for each student you read in, you allocate space dynamically for a student and store their information into that object.   Students will be in chronological order in the file – i.e. the first student in the file will be first to enter the lab. More than one student can enter the lab at any given minute.  However, when this happens, the order they appear in the file is the order in which they will be added to the Laptop Line.
Laptop Waiting Line (Laptop Queue): 
As mentioned, as soon as a student enters the lab, they must stand in line to check out a laptop. You will implement this line as a  queue.   The choice is yours as to whether this will be an array based  queue  or  a  linked  list  based  queue.    Either way,   you   will   be   using   pointers   since   each  student  is  saved  in  a  array, which is referenced by way of a pointer. 
 
 
## Stacks of Laptops: 
The  LDM  stores  all  laptops  in  a  stack  and  identifies  them  by  their  serial number. Therefore, you will implement this as a  stack.   The choice of an arraybased stack or linked-list based stack is up to you.   The input file will have a list of laptops at the beginning which will be placed into the stack.  This is constant over the whole simulation – i.e.: no new laptops are added after the beginning.  However, the order in which they are stored in the stack will surely change, just as the order of trays in a cafeteria change. Some students will use the laptops longer than others, resulting in the laptops being placed back on the stack at variable times.  Note:  the laptop stack will NOT reset to its original state after each simulated day.  Rather, the order of the laptops, at the end of any given day, will be the order for the start of the next day. 
 
## TA Waiting Line (TA Queue): 
The TA  waiting  line  will  also  be  implemented  as  a  queue;  again,  the  choice  is yours as to whether this will be an array based queue or a linked list based queue.  If you choose the latter, in addition to the head/front pointer, which points to the front of the list, it does make sense to maintain a pointer to the end of the list, thereby allowing for constant time enqueue operation. Otherwise, all enqueues result in traversing the entire list.  This also applies to the Laptop waiting queue. 
 
The TAs: 
The TAs should be stored, alphabetically*, in an array, where each cell of the array represents one TA, whose information is stored in the following class: 
 
 '''diff
class teachingAssistant { 
string name;     // only use first names for the TAs int startTimes[3]; int endTimes[3]; student studentWithTA; int minute; 
} TA; 
 ````
 
•	name is just the first name of the given TA 
•	startTimes is  an  array  of  start  times  for  each  of  the  3  days  of  the simulation. The  start  times  are stored as a number of minutes after 12:00 noon. 
•	endTimes is  an  array  of  end  times  for  each  of  the  3  days  of  the simulation.    The  end  times  are guaranteed to be later than the start times for each day, unless they are both 0, indicating that this TA has no office  hours  on  a  given  day.    Note  that  the  start  time  may  be  0, indicating that their office hours start at noon, and the end time may be something else.  Only if both numbers are 0 does it mean that they have no hours that day. 
studentWithTA is a  pointer  of  class  DataStructuresstudent, showing which specific student the TA is helping.    When a student is dequeued from the TA waiting line, what we are dequeuing is simply a pointer (an address) of that student in memory. 
•	This pointer is then saved into this member of the appropriate  TA’s object, showing that the TA is working with this student. This allows us to maintain  the  integrity  of  the   “student”,  in   memory,  therefore allowing us to the enqueue that student back into the TA waiting queue (if  they  have  more  questions) or  into  the  Laptop  queue  if  they are finished with questions. 
•	Minute is an integer indicating the number of minutes a TA has spent with their current student.  This allows you to make sure that the student only spends 5 minutes with the TA 
 
*When any TA is done helping a student and it is past their quitting time, they should leave the lab.  At this point, a check should be done to see if there are any TAs still on duty.  If not, all students currently waiting in the laptop line to pick up a laptop will need to leave, and any students in the TA line will need to move into the laptop line to return their laptops, no matter how many questions they still had. The day’s simulation should continue until all laptops have been returned to the LDM. 
 
 
## More Details: 
For the purposes of the simulation, the lab will open at noon, and “close” no later than 8:00 PM. 
Thus, you do not need to distinguish between AM and PM, as all the hours will be PM. When time is displayed, it must be displayed in standard time formatting, e.g.: “12:23 PM”, “1:30 PM”, “6:59 PM”, etc. 
 
If at any point, there are no TAs on duty, you may assume that the lab hours for the day are over, and any students still waiting in line are out of luck.  TAs will remain on duty at least as long as their office hours for each day, and possibly up to 4 minutes longer, if they are helping a student. But once their office hours are over, they may not help any new students.   If they were the last TA on duty at that point, all remaining students should return their laptops, the lab should close immediately afterwards, and you should print out the appropriate information (see output). Students who didn’t get any help that day may or may not be in the line again the next day, but you don’t need to keep track of this.
 
The following chart will help you keep track of how to organize the students into the various lines.   The “outside” box refers to the array of students that you read in at the beginning.   You will refer to this array to see when students enter the lab, which of course,  equates  to  entering the  Laptop waiting queue.    The  Laptop Queue  contains students picking up or dropping off laptops.  The TA Queue contains students who have a laptop and are waiting for a TA, and the TAs section represents students who are currently being helped by TAs.

## And now the nuts and bolts: 
 
•	The lab does not open until the first TA arrives.   You can assume that students know the TAs’ schedule and do not arrive to the lab until the lab is open (the TA is present). 
 
•	If a student is in the outside line and the current time is equal to their arrival time, they should immediately be placed into the laptop queue. As already mentioned, multiple students CAN have the same arrival time.   But the order that you place them into the laptop queue is based on the order that they are in the file. 
 
 
•	Each minute, one person may interact with the LDM (Laptop Dispensing Minion), and either pick up or return a laptop.   (Assume that this takes a full minute, so nobody else can talk with the LDM until the next minute.) 
 
 
•	If a student enters the lab at 12:20 PM, for example, they will also get in the laptop line at 12:20 PM. The borrowing takes 1 minute, so at 12:21 PM, the borrowing transaction is complete, and the student can enter the TA line. 
 
•	At every minute interval, if a TA is not working with a student, they will take a student from the front of the TA line. 
 
•	Let’s say a student begins working with a TA at 3:19 PM.  So, at 3:24 PM, they will either be enqueued back into the TA line (if they have more questions), or they will be enqueued into the laptop line to return the laptop (if they don’t have more questions).   ALSO, at 3:24 PM, that TA can immediately begin working with the next student (if one is available). 
 
 
•	So, there should be no delay from when a TA finishes with one student and takes the next. 
 
 
•	If student A enters the lab at the same time that student B finishes his Q&A session and enters the laptop line (to return a laptop), student B will enter the             Laptop line
•	BEFORE student A enters the laptop line (this just makes the coding less messy). So, you can simply process the laptop line last. 
 
 
•	If  student  A  issues a  laptop  and  enters  the  TA  line  at  the  same  time  that student   B  finishes     a  Q&A  session  and  re-enters  the  TA  line  (for  another question),  student  A  should get in the TA line first, since they haven’t had the chance to even ask one question. 
 
 
•	If a  TA  is  forced  to  stay  a  bit  longer  than  their  hours  because  they  haven’t finished that specific 5-minute question/answer, this is allowed.  However, once a TA is  past  their  official  hours,  they  may  not  help  any  new  students.     For example, if the TA finishes at 4:00PM, a student can ask a question of this TA up through 3:59 PM.   So, for example, if a student asks this TA a question at 3:57 PM, that Q/A session will finish at 4:02 PM.  But once a TA is officially no longer on duty, they cannot help a new student. 
 
•	At 8PM, all students in the TA waiting line enter the Laptop line (in their same order) to return the laptops. 
 
 
•	When the lab closes, you must empty the Laptop Queue. There is a 
possibility that some of the students in the queue at this point have no laptops.  In real life, they would  just  leave,  as there is no reason to wait in a line.    However, that complicates the code.  So we will assume that students can only leave the line via dequeuing, which translates to them staying in line until they are at the front of the line.  However, to expedite this process, if a student does not have a laptop to return, we assume that this takes ZERO time, thus allowing you to immediately work on the first actual student that does have a laptop to return.   For example, the lab closed, and we are emptying the laptop line.  At time X, let’s say there are 10 people in line, with the first three not having a laptop (they were waiting for one before the lab closed).    At time X, those three students are dequeued. Additionally, the fourth student is dequeued and initiates the laptop return. 
 
 
•	You can assume t h a t there  will always be  enough laptops for  the  number  of students; meaning, this system will never experience deadlock.   The number of laptops is equal to or greater than the number of students that will enter  the lab on a given day.
 
## Input File Specification (input.txt) 
You will read in input from a file, "input.txt". The name MUST BE “input.txt”. Have this AUTOMATED. Do not ask the user to enter “input.txt”. You should read in this automatically. (This will expedite the grading process.) 
 
The input file has a single positive integer, n, on its first line, specifying the number of laptops to be placed  in the machine.    On the next line, there will be n serial numbers, indicating each of the laptops.  These are represented as positive numbers small enough to be stored in an int variable. They should be placed into the stack in the order the numbers appear.   Thus, the last laptop on the stack will be the first one removed by the first student who needs one. 
 
On the next line will be another positive integer, t, indicating the number of TAs that will be on duty during the course of the simulation.   On the following t lines, there will  be  a  set  of  data indicating each TA’s name, along with their office hours for each of the days of the week.  These will be given in the order start, end, start, end, etc. for each of the 3 days, starting with Monday. TAs may have overlapping hours on some days, and there may be many of them on duty at once. This TA information will remain fixed over all the simulations. 
 
The  next  line  will  be  a  single  positive  integer,  p,  representing  the  number  of programs for the semester,  which,  in  turn,  represents  the  number  of  times  we need  to  run  this three-day simulation. 
On  the  next  lines  will  be  p  sets  of  data  for  each  of  the  three-day  simulations. Note, that since each of the p simulations is really a simulation over three days, each of the following p sets of data will have three days worth of information. 
 
The first line of each simulation will contain a single positive integer, m, never exceeding 300, representing the number of students who get into line for that Monday, followed by m lines containing information about each student (see below). The next line will contain a single positive integer, t, never exceeding 300, representing the number of students who get into line for that Tuesday, followed by t  lines  containing  information  about  each  student.     Finally,  the  next  line  will contain a single positive integer, w, never exceeding 300, representing the number of students who get into line for that Wednesday, followed by w lines containing information about each student. 
 
Note:  for each of the three days, and for each simulation, the order that the students are found in the input file will be the order that they arrive in the lab. 
 
## Information on each student:   
he first piece of information on each of these lines will be a non- negative integer (less than or equal to 480) representing the number of minutes, after noon, the student arrives to get into line. This is followed by  the  first  and  last  name  of  the  student  (all upper or lower-case letters with a length of fewer than 20 characters each). After this will be a single positive integer indicating the number of questions the student needs to have answered. All pieces of information will be separated by a space on each line. 
 
  
## Output Specification 
<b>***NOTE***: You should generate your output to a FILE that you will call 
“out.txt”.</b> 
For each of the semester programs (each resulting in a 3 day simulation), print out a header with the following format: 
<b> 
********** Program X: 
********** 
 </b>
Where X is the ith program of the semester.  Follow this with a blank line. For each day of the three-day simulation, print the following header: Day: where Day represents the day of the simulation (“Monday”, “Tuesday”, or “Wednesday”). 
 
Follow this with a blank line. 
 
The following lines will give information about a TA beginning or ending their lab hours, or a student either entering or leaving, picking up or returning a laptop, or starting or finishing their session with a TA. These lines should be printed in the order in which the actions occur.  The formatting for these lines is as follows: 
 
TIME: TA_NAME has begun lab hours. 
TIME: TA_NAME has finished lab hours. 
TIME: There are no TAs on duty.  Arslan is now closed. 
TIME: STUDENT_NAME has arrived in Arslan. 
TIME: STUDENT_NAME has borrowed laptop SERIAL and moved to the TA line. 
TIME: STUDENT_NAME is getting help from TA_NAME. 
TIME: STUDENT_NAME has had one question answered and gotten back in line. 
TIME: STUDENT_NAME has no more questions and will now return the laptop. 
TIME: STUDENT_NAME has returned laptop SERIAL and went home HAPPY. 
TIME: STUDENT_NAME has returned laptop SERIAL and went home FRUSTRATED. TIME: STUDENT_NAME never even got a laptop and went home FRUSTRATED. TIME:  STUDENT_NAME has had one question answered, but must now return the laptop and exit the lab. 
 
where TIME is the time the Student checked in, STUDENT_NAME is the name of the student (first name followed by a space and then followed by the last name), TA_NAME is the name of the TA, and SERIAL is the serial number of a laptop. 
 
A student  is  “happy” if  all of their questions were answered, and is “frustrated” otherwise. Students only go home happy if they had at least 75% of their questions answered.   Otherwise, they go home frustrated.   So, if a student had 10 questions, but only 7 were answered, they would go home frustrated.  But if that student had 8 questions answered, they would go home happy. 
 
The time should be printed out in the following format: (H)H:MM PM
 
The first one (or possibly two) digits represent the hour.   The hour must not be printed as 0 if it is between noon and 1:00, so you’ll need to check for this.  This is followed  by a  colon  and then the next two digits represent the minute.   If the minute value is less than 10, you’ll need to add a leading 0, so that it prints as 3:05, not 3:5.   (It probably makes sense to have a function that takes in as input the number of minutes after noon and in turn prints out the corresponding time in this format.) 
 
 
## Explanation of Output: 
Most of the output is straightforward.  The following explanation covers the few cases that may not be completely clear 
 
TIME: STUDENT_NAME is getting help from TA_NAME. 
-	This output should occur AS SOON AS the student begins working with the TA. 
 
TIME: STUDENT_NAME never even got a laptop and went home FRUSTRATED. 
-	This output should occur if a student is in line, to GET a laptop (they came REALLY late to the lab) and the lab closes before they even get a laptop. 
 
TIME: STUDENT_NAME has had one question answered, but must now return the laptop and exit the lab. 
-	This output occurs when a student is working with a TA, whose hours have finished AND who is the last TA on duty (meaning the lab is now closed).  So when that student finishes with the TA, if they have had at least 75% of their questions answered, they go home happy.  Otherwise, you need the above output. 
 
TIME: There are no TAs on duty.  Arslan is now closed. 
-	This message should only print AFTER the last TA has finished their hours AND AFTER their respective “TA_NAME has finished lab hours.” message has printed. 
 
  
## Output Day Summary: 
Follow each day’s output with one blank line.   Then you will print that day’s lab summary as follows: 
 
Day’s Lab Summary: 
The TA Lab was open for H hours M minutes. 
Y students visited the lab.  Out of those students, only Z left happy. The remaining left frustrated. 
 
Lesson Learned: do not procrastinate!  Start programs early! 
 
where  “Day’s”  represents  that  day  of  the  simulation  (Monday’s,  Tuesday’s,  or Wednesday’s). The lab is open from when the first TA arrives until the last student leaves the lab (by returning their laptop.  So, if the last TA finishes their office hours at 6:30 PM, works an extra 4 minutes with a student till, 6:34 PM, and if it then takes all the students till 6:42 PM to exit the lab, you would say that the lab is open for 6 hours and 42 minutes. 
 
Follow each day’s summary with a TWO blank lines. 
 
## ***Helpful Suggestions*** 
•	As stated, you can use either array based or linked-list based stacks and queues. 
•	Considering that the array of student pointers is in chronological order based on the time that they enter the lab, it does make sense to view this array as a queue. How is that helpful?   You are already implementing two queues (laptop and TA line), and as such, you will already be using the various array or linked-list based queue operations. Therefore, we can “peek” at the enter time of the student at the front of the queue.  If it is their time to enter, we can simple perform a dequeue operation.  Of course, you continue to dequeue for all students whose enter time as at this specific minute, as multiple students can enter at the same time. 
•	The interfaces shown in this PDF contain the minimum number of fields you need. • Feel free to add any members as you feel appropriate. 
 
  
## Implementation Restrictions 
Name the file you create and turn in Semester_Assig-Enrollement#.cpp.   You must use at least two queues and one stack (for the laptops).   You must write functions that operate on these classes  analogous  to  the stack and queue functions shown in class. Look closely at the sample input and output files provided with the assignment and make sure you follow the formatting exactly. 
 
##Grading Details Your program will be graded upon the following criteria: 
 
1)	Correctness. 
2)	Your use of functions. Even if your output is correct, you won't receive full credit if your program doesn't make appropriate use of functions. 
3)	Use of different Data structures. Since the purpose of this assignment is to teach you to use diffrernt data structures we have studied, you will not receive credit if you don't use them. 
4)	Your programming style, comments, and use of white space. 
 
 




























Solution to TA Data Structures and Algorithms Problem

"Semester Assignment_068.cpp" is the file containing the driver program

User Defined Classes:
•	Node
•	Queue
•	Stack
•	Time
•	DataStrucresStudent
•	teachingAssistant

Method to read from "input.txt"
•	Global function used to push values onto Laptop Stack
•	Member functions used to insert values in DataStrucresStudent and teachingAssistant accordingly

Method to keep track of Time
Time class made with several operators overloaded to write the main code easily. It stores time in 24hrs format but when required to display its values on Console Application or write data on file "output.txt", it writes in AM and PM format. Since our time range stays in PM, the TIME class ignored any condition to write AM.

Approach:
As the small diagram was displayed in Assignment.pdf, the same sequence was followed starting from LDM to Tas themselves.
